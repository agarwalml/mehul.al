  about:
    - Hello! Welcome to my corner of the internet.
    - I'm Mehul Agarwal, a senior studying Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (with a concentration in Machine Learning). I'm also the co-founder of Retcon, a decentralized platform for creating and trading videogame assets.
    - My research interests fall under the umbrellas of Computer Vision, NLP and blockchain. When I'm not stumped with homework, I try to find the nerdiest ways to prove that I'm cool. Some of my exploits include co-founding the Facebook group [Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens](https://www.facebook.com/groups/zoommemes/) during the pandemic, which now has 950,000+ members.

  - name: GAN-based Unsupervised Clickbait Style Transfer
    description:
      - "_Partner: Sayani Kundu, Carnegie Mellon University_"
      - Used CycleGAN based models, in particular StyleTransformer, to convert between factual news titles (non-clickbait) and viral hyperbolic and sensational headlines (clickbait)
      - We incorporate semantic and syntactic features of clickbaity text into the existing model to aid in transforming the style of a text while preserving legibility and meaning.
