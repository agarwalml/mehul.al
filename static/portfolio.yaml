  about:
    - Hello! Welcome to my corner of the internet.
    - I'm Mehul Agarwal, a senior studying Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (with a concentration in Machine Learning). I'm also the co-founder of Retcon, a decentralized platform for creating and trading videogame assets.
    - My research interests fall under the umbrellas of Computer Vision, NLP and blockchain. When I'm not stumped with homework, I try to find the nerdiest ways to prove that I'm cool. Some of my exploits include co-founding the Facebook group [Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens](https://www.facebook.com/groups/zoommemes/) during the pandemic, which now has 950,000+ members.
