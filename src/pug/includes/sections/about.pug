		p Hello! Welcome to my corner of the internet. 
		p I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science at #[a(href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target = "_blank") Carnegie Mellon University]. I also co-founded the facebook meme group #[a(href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/zoommemes/" target = "_blank") #[i Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens]] with over 700,000 members.
		p My research interests include Computer Vision, NLP and decentralized technologies. When Iâ€™m not stumped with homework, I also dabble in standup comedy and graphic designing.
